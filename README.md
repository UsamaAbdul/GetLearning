# Project Description
To begin with, in this report we have chosen our topic theme related to the 4th goal of  Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) which is “Education Quality'' for our target users. Based on our theme, we decided to develop a website to collect donations and distribute it to the schools which are facing problems of a lack of materials for learning, our organization will be called   “GetLearning''. In addition to that, we’ve also come up with a mock-up design to show the feel and look of our website. Moreover, our goal is to promote inclusive and sustainable education quality, for schools facing problems of a lack of learning materials for students and teachers. Nowadays, a lot of schools struggle with the insufficiency of study material, so by creating the “GetLearning” organisation we can help the students and teachers who are facing these problems to conduct their studies adequately.

Our website consists of five pages which are home, donation, volunteer, about us and contact us page. The fonts that we will use are open sans serif, arvo and merriweather. We aim for the website to have all the information a user needs and also be simple and minimalistic at the same time, this is in order to not overload the user with clutter and also keep the website visually appealing. The main colors we intend to use are green, brown and blue with a white background color for the website, we plan on choosing the more warmer shades of those colors. 

As mentioned before we will have a donation page on our website. This page will use a form to collect user data, after the user has filled in the form a pop up will show up asking the user to confirm that all the inputs they entered were correct, after input validation and approval from the bank then the user will have successfully made a donation. We plan to allow donations as small as RM 1 as every little thing counts.

Aforementioned, the website will  have a volunteer page. Similar to the donation page, the user information in the volunteer page will also be collected using a form. After the user is finished entering all their information, then the information will be sent to us and will be pending for  approval. Volunteering for our organization will include taking part in activities such as inventory management, donor management and field work.
